# Task-1-Collapsible-Sidebar
This project was developed as Task 1 during my Frontend Development Internship at Elevvo. The objective of the task was to create an interactive and visually appealing Sidebar Navigation Menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The sidebar includes navigational links with Font Awesome icons, a toggle button to open it, and a close (cross) button for better user experience. When the sidebar opens, the main content shifts smoothly to the right, maintaining responsiveness and user clarity. A soft pinkish color theme was used to give the interface a clean and modern look. This project helped me strengthen my skills in DOM manipulation, responsive design, and layout structuring, laying a solid foundation for future frontend development tasks.
